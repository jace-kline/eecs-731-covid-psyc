# COVID-19 Psychological Effects Analysis
### Author: Jace Kline

## Abstract
In this notebook, we center our analysis around the psychological impacts that the coronavirus has had on people in the United States. Specifically, we focus on the incidence of anxiety and/or depression amongst different population groups and states in the US. The primary data set is accessible at https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Indicators-of-Anxiety-or-Depression-Based-on-Repor/8pt5-q6wp. 

In addition to psychological trends seen amongst different population groups in the US, we also utilize US unemployment data to show visualizations that relate the unemployment rate to the incidence of anxiety and depression in the US. For this data, we use the data set accessible at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE.
